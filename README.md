This repository contains all of Spencer Brothers's contributions to the Home Credit Default Risk project. For a repository showing the full solution, visit our [group submission](https://github.com/spencer-brothers/STAR-Analytics)

## If Cloning Project From GitHub Repository

This project relies on data obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/data). In order to run the notebook, the data must be downloaded and saved to a directory named "data" in the same directory this README file and the python notebook are located.
 
## Business Problem

Most lending services are based on credit, which excludes a large demographic of people (those with no credit history) from buying a home. Taking an uninformed lending approach is an unsustainable business practice that may leave underserved populations worse off, so using smart lending practices is essential to both Home Credit’s longevity and financial equity for unbanked populations.

## Benefit of a Solution

By better modeling clients’ behaviors, Home Credit can successfully predict clients’ repayment abilities. This supports Home Credit’s goals in two key areas:

1.	Home Credit will decrease costs of clients defaulting on loans or making late payments, supporting Home Credit's sustainability in an ever-changing economic and political ecosystem.

2.	Clients capable of repayment will receive necessary resources that empower their financial success when other financial institutions fail to lend. Loans will be given with principal, maturity, and a repayment schedule that optimizes clients’ lending experience

## Difficulties Encountered

The biggest difficulty in this project was integrating everybody's work into a single notebook. We overcame this by meeting in person and setting up a main repository with a branch for each member's work. We then merged my branch to the main branch and added everybody's models to the modeling document. 

## What I learned from the project

I learned that it's really difficult to use a single method to clean data when preparing the data for multiple models. Some models need numeric data while others do better with categorical data. 

I also learned how to use github as a team, making branches and merging branches. Using AI to write code and explain github was very useful in this process.
